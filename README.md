# EmergingSystemArchitecturesAndTechnologies

**Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.**

I developed a smart thermostat using an AHT2 temperature sensor (I2C), two status LEDs to indicate heating and cooling via GPIO fade-in/out, and three buttons to toggle system states (off/heating/cooling) and adjust the set temperature using GPIO interrupts. The system displayed real-time date, time, room temperature, and set temperature on an LCD, and ouput data over UART. The prototype provided a foundation for future networked versions of the product.

**What did you do particularly well?**

I did well with troubleshooting and testing to ensure that my system aligned with business requirements. I also maintained clear modular code and well documented functions to improve readability and testing.

**Where could you improve?**

I could improve on adding more detail to my state machine diagrams by discussing what causes the different transitions between states. I will strive to improve on this during future projects.
